# SqurrielEye

We specialize in ophthalmic care for squirrels and small mammals. Our team of certified squirrel ophthalmologists are committed to preserving ocular health and enhancing vision for our furry patients.

## Our Services:

### Cataract Surgery (Phacoemulsification):
Squirrels, like humans, can develop cataracts that cloud their lenses. At SqurrielEye, we perform minimally invasive cataract surgeries using phacoemulsification. Our skilled surgeons remove the cloudy lens and replace it with an intraocular lens implant, restoring clear vision.

## Retinal Laser Therapy:
Retinal diseases can affect squirrels too. Our advanced laser treatments target retinal abnormalities, promoting healing and preventing vision loss. Whether it’s diabetic retinopathy or retinal detachment, SqurrielEye has the expertise to manage these conditions.

## Glaucoma Management:
Glaucoma, characterized by increased intraocular pressure, can lead to irreversible vision loss. Our team monitors squirrel patients for early signs, offers medical therapy, and performs laser trabeculoplasty when necessary.

## Corneal Ulcer Treatment:
Corneal ulcers can result from trauma or infections. SqurrielEye provides prompt diagnosis and treatment, including topical antibiotics, bandage contact lenses, and corneal healing agents.

## Nutritional Eye Health:
Proper nutrition plays a vital role in maintaining healthy eyes. We advise squirrel owners on optimal diets rich in antioxidants, vitamins, and essential fatty acids.


At SqurrielEye, we’re nuts about eye care!
